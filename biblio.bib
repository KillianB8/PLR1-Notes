It was recently shown that the ideas of L* can be extended to yield non-deterministic automata, and that the respective learning algorithm, NL*, outperforms L* on randomly generated regular expressions.We conjectured that this is due to the existential nature of regular expressions, and NL* might not outperform L* on languages with a universal nature. In this paper we introduce UL* -- a learning algorithm for universal automata (the dual of non-deterministic automata); and AL* -- a learning algorithm for alternating automata (which generalize both universal and non-deterministic automata). Our empirical results illustrate the advantages and trade-offs among L*, NL*, UL* and AL*.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, pages = {3308–3314}, numpages = {7}, location = {Buenos Aires, Argentina}, series = {IJCAI'15} }

We provide an algorithm which is polynomial in the size of the Q-automaton and of the maximum length of the given counterexamples. As a consequence, we have that Q-automata are PAC-learnable in polynomial time when multiplicity queries are allowed. A corollary of this result is that regular languages are polynomially predictable using membership queries w.r.t. the representation of unambiguous non-deterministic automata. This is important, as there are unambiguous automata such that the equivalent deterministic automaton has an exponentially larger number of states.",
